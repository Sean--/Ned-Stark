        <br>
        <p>The Stark family is among the oldest in Westeros, the land where "Game of Thrones" takes place. It has ruled over the North for thousands of years, and is well respected just about everywhere. The Stark symbol is a direwolf; a gigantic wolf bigger and fiercer than normal wolves. Their famous words are "Winter is coming", valid because of the harsh winters faced in the north, which can last for years on end with little respite. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Lord Eddard Stark, called Ned, is the lord of the North. He is known as an honorable and wise man. He is fair to his subjects and many of his lords love and respect him greatly. He is a somber man, but fair, and leads by example.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <h2><i class="fa fa-usd"></i> "You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark. You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move."</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Ned Stark is a kind, likable man, though he seems very cold. He is emotionless at most times, he rarely smiles or laughs, but he is a  good father to his children and an honorable man, both of which make him very unique in the world of Ice and Fire(the game of thrones series name- I worked it in there). He has 5 children, all of whom play large roles in the story. </p>

<section class="four">
    <div class="text">
        <h2><i class="fa fa-jpy"></i> "In this world only winter is certain. We may lose our heads, it's true ... but what if we prevail?"</h2>
        <br>
        <p>War is Ned Stark's downfall. He is honorable, always trying to do the right thing, but sometimes that can threaten to get a man killed. 15 or so years before the book begins, Ned Stark lead the vanguard of the army that overthrew the mad king who ruled the kingdom at the time. He fought well and won victory for himself and his co-lords, but he returned to the North, wishing to stay out of the affairs of that which was not him. However, it does not seem that he will be able to stay isolated much longer... </p>
